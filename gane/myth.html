        Explore and uncover the truth behind common Indigenous stereotypes in
        Canada.

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Myth 1: Indigenous peoples don‚Äôt pay taxes</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Most Indigenous peoples in Canada do pay
          taxes. Only specific cases involving reserves and treaties allow for
          certain exemptions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Myth 2: Indigenous peoples get free housing</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Reality:</strong> In most cases, they must wait and pay full
          price for housing. Free housing is offered only in very rare
          situations involving extreme poverty or homelessness.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Myth 3: Stereotypes are harmless</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Stereotypes can cause serious harm, like
          medical neglect and misunderstanding, and contribute to disrespect and
          inequality between communities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Myth 4: Indigenous people are satisfied with current support</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Many Indigenous individuals feel their
          struggles are ignored and that myths spread unfair judgment about
          their lives and culture.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Myth 5: It‚Äôs okay to believe what society says</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Reality:</strong> We should question stereotypes and take time
          to learn the truth. Believing misinformation just to fit in causes
          division and ignorance.
